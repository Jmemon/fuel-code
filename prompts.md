Review all phase 1 implementation. We're ANY shortcuts
  taken?
  Write up a comprehensive review of what was implemented
  and the commits to look for for all chagnes in
  phase-1-implementation-review.md
  In addition, include a review of whether any downstream
  pahses must be changed given out implementation? Will
  anything break? was anything unexpected done? Any design
  patterns should be updated? Anything? write that up
  rigorously and with healthy paranoia of giving bad
  information in phase-1-downstream-review.md
   you can use commit history to get info on what was
  changed when as well as the task files in teh roadmap




Review everything implemented in phase-2.

  Use git log to see the commits and what was implemented as
   part of hwat task. Write up a rigorous report in
  tasks/phase-2-implementation-review.md

  Then:
  Were any shortcuts taken, was anything missed or
  implemented poorly?
  Any design patterns should be updated? Will anything
  break? ESPECIALLY: look at downstream tasks (phase 3 and
  beyond). do any of these tasks expect output from phase2
  that was not implemented? will anything break? will any of
   these tasks not work? Be paranoid that we missed or
  something or mis-designed something. write up a rigorous
  review of downstream impact of our implementation and if
  any problems, the fixes in
  tasks/phase-2-downstream-review.md (if no problems, say
  so)




  fix the downstream specs add in new tasks or udpate tassk
  where needed, etc. be a rigorous and healthily paranoid
  planner
